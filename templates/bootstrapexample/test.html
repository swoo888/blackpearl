            If there are nested namespaces, these steps are repeated for each part of the
            namespace until only the view name is unresolved. The view name will then be resolved into a
            URL in the namespace that has been found. Example To show this resolution strategy in action,
            consider an example of two instances of the polls application from the tutorial:
            one called 'author-polls' and one called 'publisher-polls'. Assume we have enhanced that
            application so that it takes the instance namespace into consideration when creating and
            displaying polls.

        <div class="span4">A common need when working on a Django project is the possibility to obtain URLs in their
            final forms either for embedding in generated content (views and assets URLs, URLs shown to the user, etc.)
            or for handling of the navigation flow on the server side (redirections, etc.)
